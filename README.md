Why automate likes?
Increase chances to get people to visit your profile, hopefully they'd like what they see and stick around.

Why likes, and not follows etc?
Likes are the only soft interaction* that don't impact your profile metrics visible to users (following counts etc show up). And also follow/unfollow is rude.
